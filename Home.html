                <h3>That was the first SMS message, sent in December 1992 from a software developer in the United Kingdom.</h3>
                <h4>SMS was designed as a "short message service" between mobile phones. The messages needed to be short because mobile phone networks had constrained bandwidth at the time. A German engineer proposed the 160 character limit, justifying it based on the average length of postcard messages and telegrams.</h4>
                <div class="img1" style="text-align: center"><img src="1.png" alt="1"></div>
                <h4>The 160 character limit still holds today, but now many mobile phones make it seem like there is no longer a limit by splitting long messages into multiple pieces and stitching them back together again.</h4>
                <h4>SMS learned a few new tricks too: SMS messages can be sent to multiple recipients and include images. Still, compared to email, it's fairly limited in its functionality.</h4>
                <h4>Despite its limitations, SMS is remarkably popular. In the early 2000s, SMS usage shot up in countries without reliable Internet service, since SMS travels over the cellular networks.</h4>
                <h4>Now that many more countries do have high-speed wireless Internet, SMS is competing with messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat. Even so, it remains a common form of messaging since it works between any two phones on any network; no app download needed!</h4>

Mobile phone users are a captive audience; the average US smartphone user touches their phones more than 2,000 times a day and the average open rate for SMS messages is as high as 98%.</h4>
